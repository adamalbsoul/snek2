## Snek2

A card based approach to Snakes and Ladders.

### TL;DR (Rules)
The game is played just like the classic Snakes and Ladders game, with one major exception - there are **cards** at play!
We will assume that you know the rules to Snakes and Ladders.

# Cards
Every player gets a card at the start of their turn. It is up to them when they are going to use them.
## Mana
Notice the gem with a number in the bottom right corner of the cards. This indicates how much mana the card uses up. Mana gets replenished to 20 at the start of the turn.
